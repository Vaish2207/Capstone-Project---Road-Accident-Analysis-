# Capstone-Project-Road-Accident-Analysis-
India has the highest number of road fatalities in the world. 
In 2016, for which global figures are available, India accounted for more than a third of global road accident deaths. The World Health Organization says such deaths are under-reported and estimated that in 2016, the figure for India was likely twice as big as that reported by the government. 

In this project, perform a detailed statistical data analysis on Road Accidents of India over a period of 2003 to 2016 years using various Python Libraries.

while doing this project, i studided given dataset to analyza it on python. first i converted some files in excel to csv files, then read it on python. 
There are many challenges to perform statistical data analysis, like mean, persentage, total values show by plotting line charts, melt charts, pie charts, bar charts.
i tried and create a correct logics to perform a detailed data analysis.
Now you can see what is percentage, mean of accidents through pie charts, Ratio and graph of from bottom to top through line charts, graphical representation through bar charts.
